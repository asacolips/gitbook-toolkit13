# Features roadmap

Last Updated on **2/21/2021**

## Development Priorities

The following priorities are the general roadmap we're expecting to develop in the short term, subject to change. This list is intended as a general idea of our priorities; for a more detailed and accurate view, see the list of Gitlab milestones below.

* Documentation
* Add inline rolls to all compendiums
* Full Heal-Up and Quick Rest
* Refactor roll class
* Sheet redesign
* Active Effects
* Compendium Browser
* Compendiums for class descriptive text \(e.g. level up table\)
* TBD

## Gitlab Milestones

Currently, our code repository where we build the system has three major categories for the issues related to bugs and new features for the system:

### Immediate Tasks

The _Immediate Tasks_ board is used to track issues that are absolutely critical and must be released ASAP. For example, issues related to potential data loss or compatibility with new stable versions of Foundry will usually go into this category.

Whenever we make a release based on issues from this board, it will usually be a patch version bump, such as from 1.8.1 to 1.8.2.

### Short-Term Tasks

The _Short-Term Tasks_ board is used to track issues that are our currently development priority, but don't have a set release date yet. For example, new features like adding inline rolls to existing compendiums or adding a place for the Occultist to track their Focus.

Whenever we make a release based on issues from this board, it will usually be a minor version bump, such as from 1.8.1 to 1.9.0.

### Long-Term Tasks

The _Long-Term Tasks_ board is used to track issues that are long-term development priorities that don't have a clear release timeline yet. Issues in this category are typically large in scope or ambiguous in scope, such as adding support for Active Effects or redesigning the character sheet to be more user friendly.

Whenever we make a release based on issues from this board, it will usually be a minor version bump, such as from 1.8.1 to 1.9.0. If the changes are disruptive enough to our users, such as removing attribute types or significantly changing the tools available on the character sheet, it may instead have a major version bump, such as from 1.8.1 to 2.0.0.

### All Issues / Uncategorized

New issues are often created without being placed into a specific milestone. Those can be viewed by going to the overall issues page from the left sidebar of the Gitlab repo, or by going to the _All Issues_ board.
