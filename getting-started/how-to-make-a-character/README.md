# How to Make a Character

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to get familiar with Foundry's user interface. Characters can be made on the **Actors** tab, but see the image below for a quick run down of what those tabs in the right sidebar are.

In order from left to right:

1. **Chat Log** - Where all chat messages and power card rolls are displayed.
2. **Combat Tracker** - Track combats and combatants. Scenes can have multiple combats, and each combat will have its own escalation die.
3. **Maps/Scenes** - The scenes where you can place maps and prepare for sessions.
4. **Actors** - Where your custom characters and monsters are created and stored.
5. **Items** - All item types that can be placed on actors, such as _Powers_ or _Magic Items_ for characters or _Actions_ for NPCs.
6. **Journal Entries** - Journal entries where you can store notes that can later be placed on scenes.
7. **Rollable Tables** - Your custom rollable tables.
8. **Music/Playlists** - Foundry's music player that can be used to control your playlists.
9. **Compendiums** - Compendiums of content in your world. The system comes bundled with compendiums for each of the classes, races, and monsters in the Archmage Engine SRD.
10. **Settings** - Settings for Foundry, the Toolkit13 system, and your modules. The system includes a handful of settings that you can use to tweak it, such as average recovery rolls and a colorblind mode for accessibility.

To make either a character or monster, go to the Actors tab and click the **Create actor** button. You'll then be prompted to choose the actor type you want to create, a **Character** or an **NPC**.
