# Create a new character

To make a new character go to the Actors tab and click the **Create actor** button. Choose **Character** at the prompt that appears, and then confirm. You should then see a blank sheet similar to the following. Each of the magic sections of the sheet have been annotated, and we'll go into more detail on each of them below.

## Character Statistics \(HP, Defenses, Recoveries\)

Several of the statistics for your character can be controlled either automatically by the system, or semi-automatically via a default value that you can change later. When making a character, your first step to assign these values is to first set your **Race**, **Class**, and **Level**. Once you pick your class, your base HP, defenses, and damage die will be set for you, but you can adjust them if needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Calculating out stats based on class is a setting in the system under **Settings &gt; System settings &gt; Automatically compute base stats**. If you would prefer to control this manually, the GM can disable this setting.
{% endhint %}

If you would like to tweak these values, such as disabling automatic HP calculation for your character, you can go to the **Settings** tab of your character sheet to see the current values and make adjustments. This is also where you can find a number of **Special Traits** such _Quick to Fight_ for humans or _Strong Recovery_ for barbarians.
